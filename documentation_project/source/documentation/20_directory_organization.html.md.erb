Directory organization is one of key parts of letting `middleman-pagegroups`
take the hassle out of managing content for you.

Briefly the role of the directory layout convention is this:

- Directories equate to groups.
- Directory names equate to the group names.
- Each file in a directory, except for `index.html`, constitutes a member of
  the group.
- The `index.html` file in a directory serves as the placeholder for the
  `parent` of the group.


Each group must include at least one file that will render into `index.html`.
This file serves as the parent to the group. As such, the top-level document
of any project is `source/html.index` which is a familiar expectation in any
HTML project, and the default, top-level document for any nested directory is
also `index.html`, which is consistent with practices to which you are no doubt
already accustomed.

One important novelty of `middleman-pagegroups` is that a group’s `index.html`
file is considered a child of parent group. For example in this documentation
project’s hierarchy…

~~~
source/
  index.html         <- root object, parent to license, toc, and documentation/index.html
  license.html       <- Sort order is 20. Member of the `source` group.
  toc.html           <- Sort order is 30. Member of the `source` group.
  documentation/
    index.html       <- Sort order is 10, and is a member of the `source` group!
    concepts.html
    directory_organization.html
    …
~~~

…the files `license.html`, `toc.html`, and `documentation/index.html` are _all_
children of the `source` group. The file `source/index.html` is the child of
no one; it is the root document.

Another way to look at this is like this: the directory `documentation/`, i.e.,
the group `documentation`, is a member of the `source` group. It’s represented
by its `index.html` file.

## Nesting

Groups can be arbitrarily nested as deep as you wish. There’s probably a limit
that would cause a stack overflow and crash, but you’re not likely to reach it
unless you try deliberately.


## Sort Order

Although [Front Matter](frontmatter) is an appropriate place to specify a
page’s `:order`, it’s sometimes convenient for developers to arrange files in
order in their filesystem, too. This is supported by `middleman-pagegroups`,
too.

Simply prefix your filename with any integer followed by an underscore, e.g.,
the source file for this page is `20_directory_organization.html.md.erb`.

In order to avoid ugly URIs (e.g., `20_directory_organization.html`) make sure
that your [`config.rb`](config) file sets `strip_file_prefixes` to `true`, which
will rewrite page names without the order specifiers (e.g.,
`directory_organization.html`).

Filename sort order prefixes only work for non-group files, however. Groups and
their `index.html` files cannot be magically numbered in this way. You _must_
use the front matter `:order` key in `index.html` files, instead.

Front matter `:order` will override any order specified by file names.
